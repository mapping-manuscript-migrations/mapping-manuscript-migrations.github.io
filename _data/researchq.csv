,How many manuscripts formerly owned by Sir Thomas Phillipps are in British Libraries?,List all manifestation singletons with former owner X. Then limit the set to those with Last Known Location equivalent to Place Y and owner equivalent to Institution (not Person). COMPARE TO: list all manifestation singletons with former owner X. Then limit the set to those associated with Institutions (not Persons) in Place Y.,data testing; comparison good for documentation,,"A general browse leads easily to Sir Thomas Phillipps and thus to his collection. In the record of his collection we find a list of manuscripts owned by him (currently just over 400, thanks to Synnøve’s work). This list is ordered by shelfmark and one can count by hand all British libraries.",,Browse by “People” and select Thomas Phillipps. His role can then be filtered for “owner”. The result is a list of Oxford university and college MSS formerly owned by Phillipps.,The Oxford catalogue only covers MSS which are known to be in Oxford libraries today.,"This one is not really possible. The best you can do is limit search results to Entries with Phillipps as Provenance Agent. After that, you would have to go through every Entry/MS Record individually to determine which were last observed in British libraries.",,"In ""Manuscripts"" perspective: filter on ""Owner"" for Thomas Phillipps. This produces 8,752 manuscripts. Then filter on  ""Transfer of Custody Date"" for dates after 1872 (death of Phillipps). This produces 916 manuscripts. You can then browse the list of owners (in the Owner filter panel on the left) for those which are British libraries. (Alternatively, you can filter additionally on ""Transfer of Custody Place"" for places in Britain.) (Toby)","This is pretty clunky! It might be easier once ""Last Known Location"" has been implemented. (An alternative approach might involve starting with ""Events"", selecting ""E7 Activity"", and limiting to ""date > 1872"" + collection = ""Phillipps"".

This produces 4,319 manuscripts. The number of folios is displayed for each manuscript, where available. There is no way to find the average number of folios across the full list of manuscripts within the MMM interface itself. But if you export the results of the search and manipulate the resulting CSV file, you can find the average number of folios in that way. The answer is 159.86 folios (across a total of 3,899 manuscripts). (Toby)","You would also need to screen out of the spreadsheet those manuscripts which are only fragments, not entire codices. You should also add ""heures"" and ""horae"" to the search."
