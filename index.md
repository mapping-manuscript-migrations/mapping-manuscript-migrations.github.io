# Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM)

This website hosts the technical documentation for the Mapping Manuscript Migrations project.

Mapping Manuscript Migrations uses semantic technologies to unite records from three datasets: the _Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts_ from the University of Pennsylvania, the _Bibale_ database from the Institut de recherche et d’histoire des textes, and the _Medieval Manuscripts Catalogue_ from the University of Oxford. This project is a partnership between four institutions, funded under Round 4 of the Trans-Atlantic Platform’s Digging into Data Challenge. Contributors include the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, the Bodleian Library and the Oxford e-Research Centre at the University of Oxford, the Institut de Recheche et d’histoire des textes, and the Semantic Computing Research Group at Aalto University and the University of Helsinki.
