#### About this site

This website hosts the technical documentation for the Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) project, including the [MMM Data Model](data_model/mmm.md), [Schema](data_model/mmm-schema), and [Data Transformation Pipeline](transform/transform). A [SPARQL tutorial](sparql/sparql_tutorial.md) offers sample queries that can be modified according to researcher needs.

The MMM project mapped and transformed three separate datasets against the unified MMM data model: the [The Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts](intro/about_sdbm), [Bibale](intro/about_bibale), and the [Medieval Manuscripts in Oxford Libraries](intro/about_bod) catalogue. Each dataset's original structure and format impacted the development and implementation of the MMM data model.

Use the [public portal](https://mappingmanuscriptmigrations.org/) to search and browse the unified MMM data, or visit our [blog](http://blog.mappingmanuscriptmigrations.org/) to learn more about the project.

You can download the entire MMM dataset from Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/record/4019643](https://zenodo.org/record/4019643)

#### About MMM

Mapping Manuscript Migrations uses semantic technologies to unite records from three datasets: the [Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts](https://sdbm.library.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, the [Bibale](http://bibale.irht.cnrs.fr/) database at the Institut de recherche et d’histoire des textes, and the [Medieval Manuscripts Catalogue](https://medieval.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. This project is a partnership between four institutions, funded under Round 4 of the Trans-Atlantic Platform’s Digging into Data Challenge. Contributors include the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, the Bodleian Library and the Oxford e-Research Centre at the University of Oxford, the Institut de recherche et d’histoire des textes, and the Semantic Computing Research Group at Aalto University, Helsinki.
